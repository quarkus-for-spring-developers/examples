Example code for the [Quarkus for Spring Developers](https://red.ht/quarkus-spring-devs) eBook. Code is organized by chapter. Each project is self-contained, meaning there is no parent/child structure amongst projects.

# Versions
Whenever possible, versions of Quarkus and Spring used in these examples are kept up-to-date as much as possible. The frameworks may have evolved since the book's writing and perhaps there is a better/different way to do something than what is shown in the book's code excerpts. The code in this repository will be kept in sync with what is shown in the book so that those examples may be replicated successfully. As new editions of the book are published, examples may be changed to reflect new patterns.

Here is a summary of some of the new features which may affect the examples in the book. The examples in this repo won't be updated to take advantage of these capabilities until a new revision of the book is released.
