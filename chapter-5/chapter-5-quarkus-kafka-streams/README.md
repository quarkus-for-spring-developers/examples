chapter-5-quarkus-kafka-streams project
========================

This project illustrates how you can interact with Apache Kafka using MicroProfile Reactive Messaging.

## Kafka cluster

First you need a Kafka cluster. You can follow the instructions from the [Apache Kafka web site](https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart) or run `docker-compose up` if you have docker installed on your machine.

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:

```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

Then, open your browser to `http://localhost:8080/prices.html`, and you should see a fluctuating price.

## Anatomy

In addition to the `prices.html` page, the application is composed by 3 components:

* `PriceGenerator` - a bean generating random price. They are sent to a Kafka topic
* `PriceConverter` - on the consuming side, the `PriceConverter` receives the Kafka message and convert the price.
The result is sent to an in-memory stream of data
* `PriceResource`  - the `PriceResource` retrieves the in-memory stream of data in which the converted prices are sent and send these prices to the browser using Server-Sent Events.

The interaction with Kafka is managed by MicroProfile Reactive Messaging.
The configuration is located in the application configuration.

## Spin up the Kafka cluster with Apache ZooKeeper by Docker Compose

```shell script
docker-compose up
```

## Create Kafka Topic

```shell script
sh ./create-topics.sh
```

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./mvnw package
```
It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/chapter-5-quarkus-kafka-streams-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`
